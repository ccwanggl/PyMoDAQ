    shortDescription: >
          PyMoDAQ is an python open-source software 
          suite to efficiently setup and custom the
          acquisition program of your experiment.

    longDescription: >
          PyMoDAQ is an advanced user interface to control and synchronize detectors and actuators. 
          Each of these have their independent interface called respectively DAQ Viewer and DAQ Move control modules.
          Detectors and actuators can be wrapped together in a DashBoard which implements a particular experimental setup. 
          The Dashboard has functionalities to fully configure all its detectors and actuators and save their configurations in a preset file that will, at startup, load and initialize all modules.
          As soon as the Dashboard has been configured, all the Dashboard Extensions can be used to perform advanced and automated tasks on the detectors and actuators.
          - the DAQ Scan is the most common one. It allows to scan one or several actuators while acquiring and saving data from the detectors. 
            A very large class or experiments can be performed with this extension.
          - the DAQ Logger allows to log all the parameters of an experiment.
          - the PID extension allows to lock a parameter of the experiment with a feedback loop on the actuators.
