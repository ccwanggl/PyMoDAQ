# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

To build such a community, we encourage :
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is to be restrained.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
